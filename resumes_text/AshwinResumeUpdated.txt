PROJECTS
 
 
Music Recommendation system using scikit learn
 

 
Analyzed 1.8 GB dataset 
comprised of song metadata
 
and implemented popularity
-
based
-
recommendation
 
system, and 
item
-
based
-
recommender system.


 
Employed precision recall curve 
to compare model performances
 
and identified that item based recommender 
system performs better than popularity based recommender system
.


 
Exploratory and 
Sentimental analysis of 
I
GN Game reviews using TFlearn
 
 

 
Analyzed datasets for insights related to game genre, popularity and platforms with pie charts.


 
Performed sentiment analysis using TFlearn to predict a sentiment from a set of 11 classes.


 
Accuracy observed is 40% after using
 
three layers of LSTM with 0.9 dropout.

 
Classification of pokemons using Tensorfow
 

 
Analyzed
 
poke
mon dataset and designed 
an artificial neural network in tensorflow to classify pokemons based 
on various attribute types.


 
Achieved a prediction accuracy of 76
%.

 
Application of Kmeans Model and Gaussian Mixture Model
 

 
Applied KMeans unsupervised learning algorithm to cluster 150 2D points in space.


 
Analysed hard clustering versus soft clustering by applying expectation
 
maximization algorithm on 
Gaussian mixture model on same dataset.
